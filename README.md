Website i build for a friend.
I try to experiment MVC, routing and 'CMS' in php and i'm pretty satisfied with this home made version ;)

## Build instructions

You need composer (https://getcomposer.org/download/) to get dependancies

To install package

`composer install`

Then you could run on any PHP Server, i love this extension for VScode : https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=brapifra.phpserver
